## Installation

### Install

- Click __Raspberry > Hamradio > Update Pi and Ham Apps__.
- Check __hampi-utilities__, click __OK__.

## Check Piano script

`check-piano.sh` is run whenever the Pi starts.  It reads the position of the piano switches on the [Nexus DR-X](http://wb7fhc.com/nexus-dr-x.html) board and launches a script based on which switch levers are up or down.  The script is called by the `autostart` file located in `/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi`.  That file looks like this:

	@lxpanel --profile LXDE-pi
	@pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE-pi
	@bash /usr/local/bin/check-piano.sh
	@xscreensaver -no-splash

The script that `check-piano.sh` calls must be in the user's home directory, be marked as executable, and be named `pianoX.sh` where X is one of these:

	1, 12, 13, 14, 123, 124, 134, 1234, 2, 23, 234, 24, 3, 34, 4

NOTE: If no switch levers are in the down position, `piano.sh` will run, so there are 16 possible lever positions and corresponding scripts.

Example 1:  When the piano switch levers 2 and 4 are down, the script named `$HOME/piano24.sh`, if present and executable, will run whenever the Raspberry Pi starts.

Example 2:  When no levers on the piano switch are down, the script named `$HOME/piano.sh`, if present and executable, will run whenever the Raspberry Pi starts.
 
See [pianoX.sh.example](#piano-script-example) for an example piano script.
 
If a pianoX.sh script is not present in the home folder, no action is taken and the pi boots normally.

### Disabling the piano switch function

- Move all of the switches to the off (up) position.
- As `sudo`, open the `/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi` file.  One way to do this is to open __Terminal__, then run this command: `sudo leafpad /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi`.  __Leafpad__ is like __Notepad__ in Windows.
- Locate the line: `@bash /usr/local/bin/check-piano.sh`
- Insert `#` at the beginning of that line, so that the file looks like this:

		@lxpanel --profile LXDE-pi
		@pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE-pi
		#@bash /usr/local/bin/check-piano.sh
		@xscreensaver -no-splash
- Save the file and reboot the Pi
 
## Initialize Pi script

`initialize-pi.sh` is run whenever the Pi starts.  It runs via this line in user pi's crontab:

	@reboot sleep 5 && /usr/local/bin/initialize-pi.sh

The script checks for the presence of a file called `DO_NOT_DELETE_THIS_FILE` in the user's home directory.  If `DO_NOT_DELETE_THIS_FILE` is not present in the user's home directory, the script will reset various configuration files for ham radio applications to default values and reset the VNC Server and SSH keys.  It will then create the `DO_NOT_DELETE_THIS_FILE` file in the user's home directory.

If `DO_NOT_DELETE_THIS_FILE` is present in the home folder, the script exits without taking any action.

## Name Radios script

`name-radios.sh` allows you to change the title bar of Fldigi suite and Direwolf applications so they say something other than "Left Radio" or "Right Radio".  The associated menu entry file is `/usr/local/share/applications/nameradios.desktop`.

## Patmail script

`patmail.sh` allows the user to run [pat](https://getpat.io) within scripts rather than interactively.  Obviously, pat must be installed for it to work.  You can install Pat via __Raspberry > Hamradio > Update Pi and Ham Apps__. 

## Test Piano script

`test-piano.sh` allows you to test the operation of your `pianoX.sh` script by simulating what the [check-piano.sh](#check-piano-script) does when the Pi starts.  Set the piano switches as desired, then open a Terminal and run `test-piano.sh`.  The script will tell you which script will run based on which switch levers are down.  It will not actually run the `pianoX.sh` script.

## Direwolf and pat gui

`dw_pat_gui.sh` provides a GUI to configure the Direwolf TNC and [pat](https://getpat.io/) to make a functional Winlink email client on Hampi.  It also provides a monitor window that shows messages from both Direwolf and pat.

### Monitor tab

Shows the output of the Direwolf TNC and [pat](https://github.com/la5nta/pat/wiki) applications.  Near the top of the Monitor tab window, you’ll see a row that looks something like this:

`AGW Port: 8001    KISS Port: 8011   pat Telnet Port: 8770   pat Web Server: http://hampi-ag7gn.local:8040`

The first 3 items are port numbers that your Pi is listening on for various connections from other clients.  Use the KISS port, for example, if you have Windows PCs running Winlink Express on the same network as your Pi.

The pat Web Server URL is what you’d use to access pat’s web server from your Pi (using the Chromium browser) or from another browser on another computer on your home network.  

### Configure TNC

Configures Direwolf for AX25, ready to be used with remote Windows PCs via KISS or with pat on Linux via pat’s command line interface or it’s web interface.

### Configure pat

Configures the pat Winlink email client.  Clicking the __Edit pat Connection Aliases__ button brings up a window that allows you to search for RMS gateway stations (the output of the `pat rmslist` command) and add them to pat's connection alias list.  These aliases are available in a dropdown in the pat web interface __Connection__ dialog to make it easy to select RMS gateway stations to connect to.

pat has a restriction in that if you include a frequency in an connection alias, you must also run `rigctld` while running pat. [Hamlib]((http://hamlib.sourceforge.net/manuals/hamlib.html)), which provides `rigctld`, is already installed in Hampi. If you don't already run rigctl, this configuration gui will configure `rigctld` to use a "dummy" rig to fool pat into thinking it's talking to your radio via `rigctld`.  Note that when `rigctld` is used with a "dummy" radio, you must manually set your radio to the desired frequency.

If you make any changes in either of the Configure tabs, click __Restart Direwolf and pat__ to activate the changes.

## TNC Script

`tnc.sh` launches Direwolf and, optionally, other related apps in different modes.  The script will look for [tnc.conf](#tnc-left-tnc-right-configuration-files) in the user's home directory.  You can optionally override this behavior and specify the name and location of the configuration file using the '-c' parameter. 

The script will set up and run Direwolf to operate in any one of these modes TNC: ax25, APRS Digipeater, APRS iGate, APRS Digipeater+iGate.  It can also launch pat, ardop, pat+ax25, or pat+ardop provided those apps are also installed and configured.

## TNC left TNC right Configuration Files

`tnc-left.conf` and `tnc-right.conf` configuration files are required by [/usr/local/bin/tnc.sh](#tnc-script) script.  They contain the configuration that `tnc.sh` needs in order to operate with Direwolf as an APRS Digitpeater, iGate, Digipeater+iGate, or ax25 TNC.

__IMPORTANT__: You must edit `tnc-{left|right}.conf` with your own settings before running `tnc.sh` for the first time.

`tnc.sh` will look for `tnc.conf` in the user's home folder.  To use `tnc.sh`, you must make a symlink to the appropriate tnc configuration file for the left or right radio. 
 
- For the left radio:

		cd ~
		ln -s tnc-left.conf tnc.conf

- For the right radio:

		cd ~
		ln -s tnc-right.conf tnc.conf

You can also specify the name and location of the configuration file using the '-c' parameter.

## Trim Scripts

	trim-fldigi-log.sh
	trim-flmsg-log.sh
	trim-flrig-log.sh
	trim-fsq-audit.sh
	trim-fsq-heard.sh
	
This collection of scripts trims the logs of various applications in the Fldigi family.  They all take 1 argument: A date reference, for example: "10 days ago" or "1 hour ago".  The script will delete log entries older than the date specified.  These scripts are run whenever you launch Fldigi, Flrig and Flmsg from the __Raspberry > Hamradio__ menu.  You can change the timeframe of the trim by editing the `.desktop.` file.  For example, this is the Exec entry in the `/usr/local/share/applications/fldigi-left.desktop` file:

	Exec=sh -c '/usr/local/bin/trim-fldigi-log.sh "yesterday";PULSE_SINK=fepi-playback PULSE_SOURCE=fepi-capture fldigi --config-dir /home/pi/.fldigi-left -title "Fldigi (Left Radio)" --flmsg-dir /home/pi/.nbems-left'	
	
To change it to trim log entries older than 2 weeks ago rather than yesterday, the line would look like this:

	Exec=sh -c '/usr/local/bin/trim-fldigi-log.sh "2 weeks ago";PULSE_SINK=fepi-playback PULSE_SOURCE=fepi-capture fldigi --config-dir /home/pi/.fldigi-left -title "Fldigi (Left Radio)" --flmsg-dir /home/pi/.nbems-left'	

## Watchdog TNC Script

`watchdog-tnc.sh` runs via cron.  It launches [tnc.sh](#tnc-script) and restarts it automatically if it stops for some reason.  It is intended for use when `tnc.sh` is run in one of the APRS modes.  The script takes one argument, which it passes to `tnc.sh` as the "mode" argument.  These are examples of entries you could use in crontab (only ONE can be used at one time):

	# This one digipeats only - no internet
	*/2 * * * * /usr/local/bin/watchdog-tnc.sh digi >/dev/null 2>&1

	# This one digipeats and igates 
	*/2 * * * * /usr/local/bin/watchdog-tnc.sh digiigate >/dev/null 2>&1

	# This one igates only
	*/2 * * * * /usr/local/bin/watchdog-tnc.sh igate >/dev/null 2>&1

## Shutdown Button Script

`shutdown_button.py` monitors the shutdown button found on the DigiLink REV DS and [Nexus DR-X](http://wb7fhc.com/nexus-dr-x.html) boards.  It reboots the Pi if the button is pressed more than 2 but less than 5 seconds, or shuts down the Pi if the button is pressed for more than 5 seconds.

Your Hampi image already has the systemd service file for the shutdown script installed and enabled.  No further action is required to enable it, but __for documentation purposes only__, here's how to enable the service manually:

- As sudo, create a file called `/etc/systemd/system/shutdown_button.service` with the following text:

		[Unit]
		Description=GPIO shutdown button
		After=network.target

		[Service]
		Type=simple
		Restart=always
		RestartSec=1
		User=root
		ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/shutdown_button.py

		[Install]
		WantedBy=multi-user.target

- Run these commands in a Terminal to enable the service:

		sudo systemctl enable shutdown_button.service
		sudo systemctl start shutdown_button.service
		
- Run this command to disable the service

		sudo systemctl disable shutdown_button.service

## Radio Monitor script

`radio-monitor.py` monitors the TX/RX status of your radios via the GPIO pins (BCM 12 for the left radio and BCM 23 for the right radio).  The associated Hamradio menu item is in the `radio-monitor.desktop` file.

## Piano Script example

`pianoX.sh.example` is stored in your home folder and contains some ideas for using the piano switch feature of the Nexus DR-X boards.  Copy this file to your own script (`pianoX.sh` where `X` is 1,2,3,4 or some combination of those numbers) and edit as desired to make your Pi run certain scripts or applications at boot time.

## Desktop Template Files

These files are stored in `/usr/local/share/applications` and are used as templates for application desktop files.  They are used by the __Name Your Radio__ script to change the radio names as they appear in the Hamradio menu.

## Edit Desktop Text script

`edit-desktop.sh` allows you to edit the default Nexus DR-X desktop background, which was introduced in Hampi version 20191214. 

If your image is older than 20191214 and you want to install the customizable Nexus desktop background, you must do run these commands in the Terminal before you can run the new 'Edit Desktop Background Text’ script (__NOTE: This will REPLACE your current desktop background__):

	cp /usr/local/src/hampi/desktop-items-0.conf $HOME/.config/pcmanfm/LXDE-pi/
	pcmanfm --reconfigure

After you start the script (__Raspberry > Preferences > Edit Desktop Background Text__), enter the text you want to display and optionally check the box to show your Pi's host name, then click __OK__.  The script won't close until you Cancel, so click __Cancel__ when you're satisfied with your new desktop.

## FSQ Search script

This script monitors the `fsq_audit_log.text` file and optionally runs a user specified script upon locating a string provided by the user as search criteria.  It also prints (with an optional timestamp) messages matching the user's search string to stdout.  This script has no GUI and is designed to run in a terminal or as an autostart app in Fldigi.  Only one instance of the script runs at a time and it monitors messages for both the left and right radios simultaneously.  It will kill itself if no more instances of Fldigi are running.

For usage information, run this command in the Terminal:

	fsq_search.sh -h
	
## VNC Server Activity script

This script extracts Connection events for VNC server activity occuring in the past 24 hours and emails results via [patmail.sh](#patmail-script) and pat.

- Prerequisites
	- pat and [patmail.sh](#patmail-script) must be installed.  
	- pat must be configured. 

Before running the script, you must specify the recipient's email address(es) by editing the script.  The destination email addresses are assigned to the `MAILTO` variable.

You can execute this script automatically via cron.  The following example will run it once per day and report on the previous 24-hour's VNC connections.  This example will run at 3 minutes after midnight every day:

	3 0 * * *   /usr/local/bin/vnc-server-activity.sh 2>&1 >/dev/null
