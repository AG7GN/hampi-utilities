# This an example pianoX.sh script.

# piano scripts are user defined and they run automatically at startup 
# depending on the position of the levers of the piano switch 
# mounted on the Nexus board.

# For example, if you want to run a particular script when the 
# piano switch levers 1 and 4 are Up and 2 and 3 are down, name youor script
# nexus23.sh.  Nexus scripts must be in your home directory and must be
# executable.  You can make your script executable by running this command:

# chmod +x <script name>

# For example:

# chmod +x piano1234.sh

#===========================================================================
# This example script will change the call sign and other parameters
# in the Fldigi and Flmsg apps.  It makes these
# changes for both the left and right radios.  Edit the variables below to
# make your desired changes.

# Another thing you can do with a pianoX.sh script is to manipulate the
# desktop wallpaper, background and foreground, etc.
# Those settings are stored in $HOME/.config/pcmanfm/LXDE-pi. You're on
# your own for creating that script.

#==========================================================================
# Another thing you can do with a pianoX.sh script is to automatically
# start an application.  Anything that you can start from the menu,
# you can autostart at boot time.  You can start any application that is
# called from a desktop file in /usr/share/applications or 
# /usr/local/share/applications.  Start applications by launching the desktop
# files using gtk-launch.  For example, these commands will autostart
# fldigi on the left radio and fldigi on the right radio:

gtk-launch fldigi-left.desktop
gtk-launch fldigi-right.desktop
